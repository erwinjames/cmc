                                <h3>HOW CMC STARTED ?</h3>
                                <p>Cordova Multipurpose Cooperative is a large cooperative and one of the pioneering 
                                    cooperatives in Cebu that offers competitive financial products such as Savings,
                                     Time Deposits and Loans and other allied services to its members with a strong 
                                     mission of uplifting the lives and the socio-economic condition of the member-owners
                                      of the cooperative.</p>

                                <h3>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND </h3>
                                <p> It was in the midst of chaos and national unrest that Cordova Credit Union Incorporated was 
                                    organized and was among those pioneering organizations that responded to the call of the 
                                    National Secretariat of Social Action (NASSA). It was founded by Fr. Rudy Abao, MSC and its 
                                    pioneer members were 25 parishioners who had attended the one month long Pre-Membership Education Seminar.</p>
                                <p>The First Pre-Membership Education Seminar (PMES)was held on November 15, 2020 to December 11, 1971 
                                    and was facilitated by Fr. Rudy Abao, MSC.</p>
                                <p>The First organizational meeting was held on December 12, 1971 wherein the 25 pioneer - members put up 
                                     Php 10.00 each as their share capital contribution that totalled to Php 250.00 which eventually became the 
                                     initial capital of the Cooperative. </p>   
                                <p>On March 14, 1972 the cooperative was registered at Cooperative Administration Office (CAO) with the name 
                                      CORDOVA COOPERATIVE CREDIT UNION.</p>   
                                <p>The declaration of Martial Law on September 21, 1972 led to the enactment of Republic Act 2023 and PD 175 
                                    which mandated all Cooperatives to register in the Bureau of Cooperative Development hence, 
                                    CORDOVA COOPERATIVE CREDIT UNION with a new name, CORDOVA CREDIT COOPERATIVE INC., was registered as 
                                    full-fledged cooperative on October 5, 1973 with Certificate of Registration No. FF-01-RR. </p>
